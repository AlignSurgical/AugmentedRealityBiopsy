<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Validates a build log to check for the presence of non-build related warnings
    that may negatively affect the quality of the build.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script intends to prevent repeats of past issues that have come up
    (for example, reused GUIDs) which don't get caught in the build itself
    because they are not build errors.

    Returns 0 if there are no errors, non-zero if there are.
.PARAMETER LogFile
    The log file to validate
.EXAMPLE
    .\validatebuildlog.ps1 -LogFile c:\path\to\log.txt
#>
param(
    [string]$LogFile
)

function CheckDuplicateGuids(
    [string[]]$LogFileContent,
    [int]$LineNumber
) {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Checks if the given log file has a conflict guid at the specified line number.
        Outputs to console if such an error exists.
        Returns true if there is a duplicate guid.
