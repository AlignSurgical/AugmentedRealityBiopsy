// When the .NET scripting backend is enabled and C# projects are built
// The assembly that this file is part of is still built for the player,
// even though the assembly itself is marked as a test assembly (this is not
// expected because test assemblies should not be included in player builds).
// Because the .NET backend is deprecated in 2018 and removed in 2019 and this
// issue will likely persist for 2018, this issue is worked around by wrapping all
// play mode tests in this check.
